                <p id="paraOne">Lorcana is a Trading Card Game (TCG) made by Disney, like Pok√©mon or Magic the Gathering. The cards are fun to 
                                trade, look at the art, and to play the game against opponents. You play with some classic characters of 
                                Disney lore, including Mickey Mouse, Cinderella, Hei Hei, Genie, and more!
                </p>
                <p id="paraTwo">Lorcana is probably my favorite table-top game, and it's a shame that more people don't know what it is. One of my
                                favorite things about it is that it is so friendly to everyone. People who might not want orcs and monsters love that 
                                that they can play with some of their favorite characters!
                </p>
                <p>There are so many other reasons to love Lorcana, but there is only so much I can describe about it. Just know it is a chill,
                    strategic game that is fun for everyone!

            <p>If you want to get into Lorcana, I would suggest starting with a starter deck, which is a 
                deck that is pre-made and usually does pretty well on its own. You can find starter decks
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/lorcana-starter-deck/s?k=lorcana+starter+deck">online</a> or 
                at board game stores.
